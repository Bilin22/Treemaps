=== Module Description ===
This module contains the basic tree interface required by the treemap
visualiser. You will both add to the TMTree class, and complete implementations
of several subclasses to represent specific types of data.

    the os.path.getsize function.

    *exactly* the same, so this doctest _might_ not pass when run on

    corresponding to this doctest example.

              function to ensure consistent ordering and contents of the
              returned list of file and directory names when traversing the

class TMTree:
    """A TreeMappableTree: a tree that is compatible with the treemap
    visualiser.

    While this is not an abstract class,
    it should be subclassed to fit the needs of the
    specific data being visualized.

    You may NOT add any attributes, public or private, to this class.

    You can freely add private methods as needed.

    === Public Attributes ===
    rect:
        The pygame rectangle representing this node in the treemap
        visualization. A pygame rectangle is of the form:
        (x, y, width, height) where (x, y) is the upper, left corner of
        the rectangle.
    data_size:
        The size of the data represented by this tree.

    === Private Attributes ===
    _colour:
        The RGB colour value of the root of this tree.
    _name:
        The root value of this tree.
    _subtrees:
        The subtrees of this tree.
    _parent_tree:
        The parent tree of this tree; that is to say, the tree that contains
        this tree as a subtree, or None if this tree is the root.
    _expanded:
        Whether this tree is considered expanded for visualization.

    Note: this class does not support a representation for an empty tree,
    as we are only interested in visualizing non-empty trees.

    === Representation Invariants ===
    - data_size > 0
    - _name is a non-empty string
    - If _subtrees is not empty, then data_size is greater than or equal to the
    sum of the data_size of each subtree.

    - _colour's elements are each in the range 0-255, inclusive

    - if _parent_tree is not None, then self is in _parent_tree._subtrees
    - if _parent_tree is None, this is a root of a tree (no parent)
    - this tree is the _parent_tree for each tree _subtrees

    - if _expanded is True, then _parent_tree._expanded is True
    - if _expanded is False, then _expanded is False for **every** subtree
      in _subtrees
    - if _subtrees is empty, then _expanded is False
